# Hey there! üëã I'm Arunaggiri Pandian Karunanidhi.

I'm a data scientist passionate about teaching computers to see the invisible. My main gig involves building sophisticated AI models to spot microscopic, multi-million dollar defects on silicon wafers. It's like finding a needle in a haystack, but the haystack is the size of a city and the needle is changing shape.

When I'm not wrangling data, you can find me diving into the latest in Generative AI or mentoring the next wave of data scientists.
